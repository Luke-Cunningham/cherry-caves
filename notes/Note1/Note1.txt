* Moving platform 
* Purple Octopus movement

Add one or more cherries to the level that puts Berry into "frenzy" mode
* He stays in this mode for 5 seconds (play the snd_frenzy during that time)
* While in frenzy mode, change Berry in some way (his size, his image color, something)
* While he's in frenzy mode, he can just collide with any enemy and destroy them, no need to jump on them and he can't be destroyed by them
